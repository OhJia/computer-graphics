My background is in design and visual art. I've worked with many graphics tools and took for granted when I just drag and drop a color into a gradient or draw a shape. I want to look under the hood and gain greater control over the tech that I use to create. I am also excited for the future of desktop and mobile browsers and beyond. These are just some of the reasons I'm taking this class. 

My goals for the class is to build a simple 3D computer graphics system and make cool projects like this or this: http://csh.bz/

I enjoyed this talk and would love to hear more about ChalkTalk and how matching drawing to an image database works, the ARCADE project, and relating to that project, VR.
